# 📘 Data Structures

Welcome to my **Data-Structures** repository!  
This repo is a collection of my **learnings, notes, and implementations** of various data structures in different programming languages.  
The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and build a solid foundation in **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).** 🚀

---

## 📚 Contents

### 1️⃣ Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack
- Queue (Normal, Circular, Deque, Priority Queue)

### 2️⃣ Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Heap)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms)

### 3️⃣ Hashing
- Hash Tables
- Hash Maps & Collision Handling

### 4️⃣ Advanced Concepts
- Tries
- Segment Trees
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU / Union-Find)

---

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository
- 📒 Document step-by-step **notes** for quick revision  
- 💻 Implement each data structure with **clean code**  
- 🧩 Practice problems to strengthen understanding  
- 🏆 Prepare for **coding interviews & competitive programming**

## 🌟 How to Use This Repo

1. Open the folder of the topic you want to learn.
2. Go through the notes/code to understand the implementation.
3. Try solving the included problems for practice.
4. Use it as a **reference guide** during interview prep.

## 🏆 Long-Term Goal

By the end of this journey, I aim to:

* ✅ Master all fundamental data structures
* ✅ Solve **500+ DSA problems** across platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG)
* ✅ Build a strong foundation for **system design & advanced algorithms**
